This is a port of Pam's Harvestcraft 2 Mods from CurseForge. 

This pack contains the following:
- Pam's Harvestcraft crops;
- Pam's Harvestcraft trees;
- Pam's Harvestcraft foodcore;
- Original crafting recipes;
- Original hunger and saturation values.

All of the configuration was made to mimic the original mod. It contains over 20K lines of configuration and it's available for free <3

Sadly, i cannot provide the textures from Pam's mods since she didn't give me permissions but you can easily extract the assets from her mods and drop them inside the resource_pack folder from ItemsAdder.
